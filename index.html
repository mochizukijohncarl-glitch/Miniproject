    <h4 class="fill-text">Have you ever visited the famous Sinking Bell Tower in Laoag?</h4>
    <h1 class="fill-text2">Sinking Bell Tower</h1>
    <p>The Sinking Bell Tower is one of the most iconic landmarks and historical Laoag City tourist spots in Ilocos Norte province. Located in the heart of Laoag City, just a few minutes’ walk from the city plaza and St. William’s Cathedral, this centuries-old structure stands as a testament to the city’s Spanish colonial past and unique architectural heritage.</p>

    <p>Rising at nearly 45 meters high, the bell tower is famous not only for its impressive size and solid construction but also for its gradual descent into the ground—hence its name. Built on sandy foundations in the 1600s by Augustinian friars, the tower reportedly sinks by an inch every year due to its weight and the soft ground beneath it.</p>
    
    <p>For travelers exploring the city's attractions, the Sinking Bell Tower is often included in guided Laoag tours. The site is best appreciated on foot, especially during golden hour when the tower’s weathered facade glows beautifully against the sky.</p>

    <h1 class="fill-text2">Museo Ilocos Norte</h1>
    <p>Museo Ilocos Norte is situated in Laoag, Ilocos Norte. It is an excellent representation of the rich heritage of Ilocos and the ethnography of the Ilocanos, Igorots, Itnegs, Yapayaos and other ethnicities of the province.</p>

    <p>This museum in the Philippines is housed in an existing Tabacalera, or tobacco warehouse, close to the Provincial Capitol. The warehouse used to be a plain brick structure, one of the chains of brick structures built in Ilocos during the 19th century. The Tabacalera was then converted into an enthralling two-story museum.</p>
    
    <p>From the old household implements to farming equipment to the ancient bahay na bato house models to the significance of garlic in their lives, a trip to the Ilocos Museum is a visual treat. </p>

    <h4 class="fill-text">Chase the sunset, ride the dunes — La Paz Sand Dunes awaits!</h4>
    <h1 class="fill-text2">La Paz Sand Dunes</h1>
    <p>Laoag, Ilocos Norte has a natural tourist attraction that offers something different from the usual beaches of the Philippines. Found close to Laoag City, the capital city of Ilocos Norte, the La Paz Sand Dunes is a sandy coastal desert that covers an area of 85 square kilometers near the coast of the West Philippine Sea and is one of the top tourist spots in Ilocos Norte.</p>

    <p>The La Paz Sand Dunes is a segment of the Ilocos Sand Dunes that spans the length of Currimao (north of Laoag) to Pasuquin (south of Laoag). On November 26, 1933, its significance was cemented as the National Committee on Geological Sciences (NCGS) identified it as one of the National Geological Monuments in the Philippines.</p>
    
    <p>This wild terrain is popular for its varying sand dunes that can be as high as 30 meters. The La Paz Sand Dunes are only 10 to 15 minutes away from the city via tricycle or public jeepney. For a stress-free experience, you may also book Laoag tours that will pick you up from your accommodations in Ilocos Norte and take you to the sand dunes. It’s highly recommended to visit the area before sunrise or before sunset to avoid the heat and to have the most scenic view of the beach from the top of the sand dunes.</p>

    <h1 class="fill-text2">St. William’s Cathedral</h1>
    <p>Located at the heart of Laoag City in Ilocos Norte Province, St. William Cathedral, also known as Laoag Cathedral, is one of the most prominent religious landmarks in northern Luzon region. This centuries-old Roman Catholic church is dedicated to Saint William the Hermit and features a striking blend of Italian Renaissance and Baroque architectural styles. Its grand facade, ornate interiors, and cultural significance make it a must-visit stop on any Ilocos Province itinerary.</p>

    <h4 class="fill-text">Ever seen the Tobacco Monopoly Monument? It stands as a proud reminder of Ilocos Norte’s rich history and resilience — a must-visit for every local and traveler!<h4>
    <h1 class="fill-text2">Tobacco Monopoly Monument</h1>
    <p>The Tobacco Monopoly Monument in Ilocos Norte is a historical landmark commemorating an important era in Philippine history. It is a brick obelisk in Aurora Park in Laoag City, which stands as a testament to the significant role tobacco played during the Spanish colonial period when the government monopolized the cultivation and sale of tobacco. It commemorates the abolition of the tobacco monopoly, which forced farmers into abusive labor. An inscription on the obelisk reads, “erected by the people as an expression of joy” over the termination of the monopoly.<p>
    <p>The monopoly resulted in great revenue but fueled corruption by the authorities against the Filipino farmers. They forced the townsfolk to plant no other crop but tobacco and sell only to the Spanish government. All the products were strictly controlled in warehouses like the Tabacalera building in Laoag. The building still stands to this day as Museo Ilocos Norte.</p>
