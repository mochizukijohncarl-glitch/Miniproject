    <h4 class="fill-text">From Samtoy to Cityhood... The Timeless Journey of Laoag.</h4>
    <h1 class="fill-text2">THE RICH HISTORY OF LAOAG CITY</h1>
    <p>Laoag City, the capital of Ilocos Norte Province, is a vibrant cultural and historical center in Northern Luzon region. Dubbed the “Sunshine City,” Laoag is where Spanish colonial charm meets Ilocano resilience, with baroque churches, ancestral homes, and iconic landmarks around every corner.</p>
    <p>Long before the Spaniards ever set foot on Philippine soil, the northern lands we now know as Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, Abra, and La Union were already thriving. These areas were famous for their rich gold mines, attracting merchants from faraway Japan and China. Traders would sail to the shores of the region, bringing with them colorful beads, fine ceramics, and smooth silk in exchange for the precious gold found in the mountains.</p>
    <p>The people who lived there were Austronesians, and they called their land Samtoy, from the phrase sao mi itoy, which meant “this is our language.” It was a proud name that reflected how deeply they valued their identity and way of life.</p>
    <p>Then came the Spaniards. In 1571, after gaining control of Manila, they turned their eyes north in search of new lands to conquer. The young explorer Juan de Salcedo, grandson of the famous Legazpi, took on the challenge. At just 22 years old, Salcedo set out with eight boats and forty-five men, heading into the unknown.</p>
    <p>On June 13, 1572, they reached Vigan, then journeyed farther north to Laoag, Currimao, and Badoc. Sailing along the coastline, they were struck by the sight of peaceful coves, or looc as the locals called them, where communities lived in harmony with the sea. Inspired by this, they named the land “Ylocos” and its people “Ylocanos.”</p>
    <p>As Spanish influence spread, so did their religion. Churches and tall bell towers began to rise from the ground, symbols of faith and power built under King Philip’s decree known as bajo de las campanas, meaning “under the bells.” It was said that wherever the sound of the church bells reached, so too did the rule of Spain. The plaza became the heart of every town, often guarded by soldiers beneath the shadow of those same bells.</p>
    <p>But the Ilocanos were not ones to bow easily. Despite centuries of colonization, their spirit of resistance burned bright. Abuses by the friars led to many uprisings such as the Dingras revolt in 1589, Pedro Almazan’s rebellion in 1616, and the legendary fight of Diego Silang in 1762. When Diego was betrayed and killed, his wife Gabriela Silang fearlessly took his place, continuing the struggle until her capture and execution.</p>
    <p>In 1807, the people of Piddig rebelled again in what became known as the Basi Revolt, protesting the government’s control over sugarcane wine. And in 1898, a priest named Gregorio Aglipay stood up to the Spanish church, choosing to side with General Emilio Aguinaldo’s revolution. Excommunicated but undeterred, Aglipay founded the Iglesia Filipina Independiente, giving Filipinos a sense of spiritual independence and pride.</p>
    <p>Over the years, Ilocos grew as its population exploded from less than 20,000 in 1715 to nearly 300,000 by 1818. Managing such a vast province became too difficult, especially with constant revolts and unrest. So, by royal decree on February 2, 1818, Spain decided to divide Ilocos into two: Ilocos Norte and Ilocos Sur. Laoag, being the largest and most vibrant town, became the capital of Ilocos Norte.</p>
    <p>Centuries later, Laoag continued to grow and modernize. In 1965, the town officially became a city, with Eulalio F. Siazon serving as its first mayor. Yet even with all its progress, Laoag never lost sight of its roots, a land shaped by gold, courage, and the unyielding spirit of its people.</p>
